\subsection{OO vs FP}

\begin{frame}{Object oriented vs functional programming}
	Some key aspects to keep in mind:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\text{FP} \neq \text{OOP} - \text{classes}$
		\item FP is \stress{not} the opposite of OOP: Both paradigms take opposite stances in several aspects: declarative vs imperative, mutable vs immutable, \dots{} $\Longrightarrow$ Not everything can be classified into one of these categories
		\item Rather: Two different \hhl{ways to think} and to approach problems \srem{$\longrightarrow$ see caveats at the beginning}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\medskip	
	In a multi-paradigm language, you can use the best of both worlds!
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \hhl{OOP} has its classical use cases where there is strong coupling between data and methods and the bookkeeping is in the focus (especially of "real-world" objects)
		\item \hhl{FP} instead focuses on algorithms and \emph{doing} things
		\item Some people advocate \hhl{\enquote{OOP in the large, FP in the small}} \srem{(using OOP as the high level interface, using FP techniques for implementing the logic)}
	\end{itemize}

	For example:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Many complicated class structures implementing \hhl{manipulations} can be made more flexible with a system of high level functions, anonymous functions etc.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
