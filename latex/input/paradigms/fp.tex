\subsubsection{Strenghts and Weaknesses}

\begin{frame}{Strenghts and Weaknesses}
\begin{block}{Strengths}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Proving things mathematically
		\item Testing things
		\item Very short and concise notations of algorithms
		\item Sophisticated abstractions of logic $\lra$ very high code reuse
		\item Performance boost because of easy parallelization
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Weaknesses}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Less \enquote{natural} way to approach problems (\enquote{objects} are a natural way of thinking to most people)
		\item Steeper learning curve
		\item Can be harder to read (higher level functions, recursions, ...)
		\item Performance issues due to immutability
		\item More academic, but gaining traction 
	\end{itemize}
