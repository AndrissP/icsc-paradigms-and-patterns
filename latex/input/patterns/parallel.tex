	\begin{quote}
		Concurrency patterns need their own lecture, so this will only quickly mention basic concepts.

	\bigskip
	Use cases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Managing data access: \hhl{Locking}/\hhl{guarding}: \srem{(mutual exclusion concurrency control: e.g. while one thread is writing data field, all other threads have to wait before reading the field)}. Need to be careful to avoid \hl{dead-locking}.
		\item \hhl{Scheduling} tasks in parallel
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item {Thread pool}
%			\item {Compute kernel} 
%			\item \dots
%		\end{itemize}
		\item (A)synchronous \hhl{event handling}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Concurrency Patterns II}
	Advanced example: \hhl{Active object} pattern

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Want to decouple method calling from method execution
		\item Can request a calculation early and check later whether the result is available
	\end{itemize}
	
	\bigskip
	The pattern consists of multiple components:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The \hhl{client} calls a method of a \hhl{proxy}, which (immediately) returns a \hhl{future} object \srem{(can be used to check if results are available and get them)}
		\item At the same time the proxy turns the method call into a \hhl{request} object and adds it to a \hhl{request queue}
		\item A \hhl{scheduler} takes requests from the request queue and executes it \srem{(on some thread)}
		\item Once the request is executed, the result is added to the future object
	\end{itemize}
